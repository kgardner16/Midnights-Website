# Midnights-Website
First website I created in HTML. Made in 2022, updated in 2024.

This project was designed to help us begin to grasp and develop our knowledge of HTML and web design. We were allowed to pick the subject of the website, so I selected my favorite music artist, because I know so much about her, and I work well on projects in which I am passionate about the subject.

Main takeaways from this website: learning how to include video/article hyperlinks, how to change font/color/etc of headers and body text, and how to feature images. 

Future goal for website: continue to develop my knowledge of web design and HTML in order to elevate this website and make it look more professional. Ideally, I would like the website to include multiple pages, with tabs/buttons allowing the user to navigate between them, and a more visually appealing design for the site overall.
